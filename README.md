CSV Editor implemented with QTableView and QStandardItemModel


## Features
- **Absolutely cross-platform**, just uses Qt 5.15.
- **Supply any CSV** to the program through the native file explorer.
- **Sort** with respect to any column
- **Find** using `Ctrl+F`, trigger a search using `ENTER` keypress, `Find` PushButton, or live searching as you type!
    - perform **Case Insensitive** search - just flick the switch!
    - **instant visibility of match** - matched cell gets colored <font color = "green">Green</font>
        - view gets scrolled to the first matched cell. UX is bae.

- **Edit** CSV with live saving as and when a cell is edited and Ctrl+S support.
- **Quit** the editor with a simple ESCAPE keypress. UX is bae.
